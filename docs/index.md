I’m actively developing OXI and using this space to host my development logs.
The long‑term goal is to make OXI approachable for newcomers, while giving experienced XR developers a clean, structured API for Unity‑based OpenXR projects.

## 📓 Dev Logs

Follow along with design decisions, technical deep dives, and progress updates.

- **2025‑08‑12 (Supplemental)** — [OXI’s Structured API Philosophy]({{ site.baseurl }}/devlog/8-12-25-s01/)
- **2025‑08‑11** — [Pose-Centric Tracking and Input System Wiring]({{ site.baseurl }}/devlog/8-11-25/)

## 📖 Manual *(Coming Soon)*

High‑level philosophy and the structure of OXI: why roles, providers, and receivers exist, and how the path‑based API forms a consistent mental model.

Planned topics:
- OXI goals and constraints
- Role‑first design
- Providers vs. Receivers
- Path semantics and naming
- Portability and vendor‑agnostic choices

## 💻 OXI Coding *(Coming Soon)*

The scripting reference, intentionally named **“OXI Coding”** (a wink at the common mispronunciation “Oxycodine”) because this section is here to remove the pain of messy XR APIs.

Planned topics:
- Namespaces and assemblies
- Core types and adapters
- Unity integration layer
- Events, data providers, and receivers
- Examples and patterns

---

## 🛠 Status

OXI is in active development. Documentation will expand as the API stabilizes.
